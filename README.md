# Math Modelling

This repository contains materials and examples for the **Mathematical Modelling** course.  
It introduces basic principles of mathematical and computer modelling, combining theory with practical implementations.

## Topics
- Algebraic, differential, and stochastic models  
- Physical processes: waves, elasticity, heat transfer, diffusion  
- Complex and chaotic systems: nonlinearity, bifurcations, chaos  
- Biological and ecological models: wound healing, population dynamics  
- Social and economic processes: optimization, epidemics, networks
